## Dioxus Template with Anchor & Tailwind CSS

### Requirements
1. This template relies on Tailwind CSS to generate the stylesheet. 

Install the standalone Tailwind CLI - [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli)
2. Install Dioxus cli from official website - [https://dioxuslabs.com/](https://dioxuslabs.com/)


### Running the dev server
1. Start the tailwind CLI within the Root of the directory
    ```sh
    tailwindcss -i ./tailwind.css -o ./assets/tailwind.css --watch
    ```
2. The default public key is the same across all templates so use `sync` to generate and sync a new anchor program ID
    ```sh
    anchor keys sync
    ```  
3. Generate the anchor IDL

    ```sh
    anchor build
    ```
4. Switch to frontend directory
    ```sh
    cd frontend 
    ```
5. Start the Dioxus CLI
    ```sh
    dx serve
    ```

- Open the browser at default port http://localhost:8080 or the port described by Dioxus CLI in case port `8080` was already in use

- Sometimes there are warning in the browser console, use `dx check` command to find if there are fixes that need to be done.
